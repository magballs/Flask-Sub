# Flask-Sub
First legit project learning terminal, raspberry, flask, python and a little about twitch's eventsub system.
13.01.24
  Trying to set up a flask app on my raspberry to listen for events from the twitch api.
  This is meant as a learning project, and trying to use newly acquired skills to automate basic things, like a stream timer.
  This will eventually turn into bigger projects, but for now I am stuck on getting eventsub to actually validate my twitch signature.
